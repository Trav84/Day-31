	1.1 If they are a student, it takes them to the student page where they can upload a github link and also comments on how their homework went.
	1.2 If they are an instructor, it logs them into the instructor page where they can see a table of all the students. When the instructor logs in, it does a get request to pull the array of information about students down and it populates the list.

If the instructor makes a change on an assignment, the submit button does a post request to change the information in the data and push it to the server.
